          <h3>The Meeting</h3>

          <img src="img/pic1.jpg">

          <p>It was a bright and sunny morning in Kandivali, less than 12 hours after an intensive and exhausting multi-round interview (between Arpan and Mudita's parents, which Arpan passed with flying colors) - he and his parents were joining Mudita and family for lunch. It was a comfortable setting, and their first meeting proceeded like pretty much every conversation since then: Mudita, looking very cute, spoke at length about many random topics while Arpan, looking quite handsome, spent most of the time listening. It was a match made in Heaven!</p>

          <h3>The Meeting: Part 2</h3>

          <img src="img/pic2.jpg">

          <p>Arpan had a strong feeling that this girl was the one for him - she was passionate about her work, she had deep ties with her family, she had strong values... the list goes on. So almost immediately after leaving their house, Arpan asked his parents to arrange a second meeting later that afternoon, so that he could talk to her again before departing India. Mudita, for her part, had her own intuition - here was an extremely handsome guy with all sorts of positive qualities, and she would have another chance to talk... a lot... while he listened.</p>

          <h3>The Engagement</h3>

          <img src="img/pic3.jpg">

          <p>The happy couple was engaged on May 25, 2013 in Arpan's home town of San Diego - it was a festive affair, with dancing (including select items from Arpan &amp; Mudita), food, and tons of photos! As anyone who knows Mudita would expect - her lehenga was gorgeous and Arpan's suit was sharp (and matching!)</p>
